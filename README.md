# Callum Thickett Portfolio
A collection of my latest data analytics and data science projects.

## [Project 1: Google Analytics Capstone Project: Improving The Subscriber Count Of A Bikeshare Company.](https://github.com/thickett/Capstone-Project-improving-a-bikeshare-company)
### Project overview:
 * Compiled data from multiple sources using SQL. 
 * Cleaned millions of rows of Data using both SQL and R.
 * Utilised R to manipulate and analyse the data.
 * Created compelling data visualizations with R to present findings.
 * Designed a mock report for my findings.

 ## [Project 2: IMDB_webscraping_analysis - work in progress](https://github.com/thickett/IMDB_webscraping_analysis)
### Project overview
An all encompassing project where I scrape, clean, manipulate and engineer data to create a predictive model that can successfully predict movie IMDB ratings based off of a number of predictor variables. 


The project was split into three main sections:
### 1) Web Scraping 
* Created from scratch a web scraper in R that could:
  * Successfully scrape data from multiple pages and subpages. 
  * Collate the collected data into a tidy dataframe with thousands on records.
* Produced several web scraperers to solve data cleaning problems. 

### 2) Data Cleaning
* Extracted important information from complex strings to create tidy, informative variables using custom made functions.
* Feature engineered new variables to present the data in a more meaningful way.
* Made decisions on how to correctly navigate missing and incorrect data.
* Ensured data integrity was maintained throughout.

 ### 3) exploratory analysis and feature engineering 
 
 
 ### 4) feature and model selection
